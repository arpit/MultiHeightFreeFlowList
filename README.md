MultiHeightFreeFlowList
=======================

An example of a [FreeFlow](https://github.com/Comcast/FreeFlow) Layout that lays out strings of different sizes. The Layout in the example uses StaticLayout to calculate the heights of the strings based on the size of the container and then uses those heights in the prepareLayout method to generate the appropriate Rects for the FreeFlowItem instances
